# Cache Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Updates
- **serverless.yml**: Updated `CACHE_TIME_EXCHANGE_RATE` from 21600 (6 hours) to 3600 (1 hour)
  - US stocks: 3600 seconds (1 hour) ✓
  - JP stocks: 3600 seconds (1 hour) ✓
  - Exchange rates: 3600 seconds (1 hour) ✓
  - Mutual funds: 10800 seconds (3 hours) ✓

### 2. Code Updates

#### Enhanced Market Data Service (`src/services/sources/enhancedMarketDataService.js`)
- Added cache time configuration to all `fetchDataWithFallback` calls:
  - `getUsStockData`: Uses `CACHE_TIME_US_STOCK` (1 hour)
  - `getJpStockData`: Uses `CACHE_TIME_JP_STOCK` (1 hour)
  - `getMutualFundData`: Uses `CACHE_TIME_MUTUAL_FUND` (3 hours)
  - `getExchangeRateData`: Uses `CACHE_TIME_EXCHANGE_RATE` (1 hour)
- Added cache configuration to all `fetchBatchDataWithFallback` calls

#### Data Fetch With Fallback Utility (`src/utils/dataFetchWithFallback.js`)
- Updated `fetchBatchDataWithFallback` to accept cache configuration parameter
- Ensured cache configuration is passed to individual `fetchDataWithFallback` calls

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Updated CLAUDE.md to reflect the new exchange rate cache time (1 hour instead of 6 hours)

## How It Works

1. **Data Request Flow**:
   - When market data is requested, the system first checks the DynamoDB cache
   - If cache hit and data is not expired, it returns the cached data immediately
   - If cache miss or expired, it fetches from external APIs/sources

2. **Cache Storage**:
   - After successful data fetch, the data is stored in DynamoDB with appropriate TTL
   - TTL is set based on data type:
     - Stock prices (US/JP): 1 hour
     - Exchange rates: 1 hour
     - Mutual funds: 3 hours

3. **Automatic Expiration**:
   - DynamoDB automatically removes expired items based on TTL
   - No manual cleanup required

## Benefits

1. **Reduced API Calls**: Significantly reduces calls to external data sources
2. **Improved Performance**: Cached responses are served much faster
3. **Cost Savings**: Fewer external API calls mean lower costs
4. **Better Reliability**: Cache serves as a buffer during external API outages

## Deployment

To deploy these changes:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

For production:

```bash
npm run deploy:prod
```

## Testing

Cache functionality can be tested:

```bash
# Run cache-specific tests
npm test -- --testNamePattern="cache"

# Test with a specific symbol
curl "https://your-api-gateway-url/marketData?type=us-stock&symbols=AAPL"
# First call will fetch from API
# Subsequent calls within 1 hour will use cache
```
