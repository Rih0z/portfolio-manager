# Build for production
npm run build

# Run all tests with coverage
npm test

# Run specific test suites

```

## Architecture Overview

This is a React-based portfolio management application with AI-powered investment analysis capabilities. Key architectural decisions:

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with functional components and hooks
- **Context API** for state management (AuthContext for auth, PortfolioContext for portfolio data)
- **TailwindCSS** for styling with custom theme colors
- **Recharts** for data visualization
- **Google OAuth** for authentication
- **Axios** for API calls with retry logic

### Testing Architecture
- **Jest + React Testing Library** for unit/integration tests
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** for API mocking
- Custom test runner script (`script/run-tests.sh`) with advanced options
- Coverage thresholds enforced (70-80% target)
- Visual coverage reporting with chart generation

### Key Patterns

1. **Service Layer Pattern**: All API calls go through `/src/services/` modules
   - `api.js`: Core API client with auth handling
   - `marketDataService.js`: Market data fetching with fallbacks
   - `adminService.js`: Admin functionality

2. **Context Bridge Pattern**: `ContextConnector` component bridges AuthContext and PortfolioContext

3. **Environment Configuration**: API endpoints configured via environment variables
   - Development: `.env.development`
   - Test: `.env.test`
   - Production: `.env.production`

4. **Component Organization**:
   ```
   components/
   ├── auth/       # LoginButton, UserProfile
   ├── common/     # ErrorBoundary, ToastNotification, etc.
   ├── dashboard/  # Portfolio visualization components
   ├── data/       # Import/Export, Google Drive integration
   ├── layout/     # Header, TabNavigation, DataStatusBar
   ├── settings/   # Holdings/Allocation editors, AI prompt settings
   └── simulation/ # Investment simulation components
   ```

## Important Implementation Details

### API Integration
- Uses proxy in development (`setupProxy.js`)
- Production API hosted on AWS (separate repository)
- Supports multiple market data sources with automatic fallback

### Multi-Currency Support
- Handles JPY and USD
- Exchange rate fetching from multiple sources
- Automatic currency conversion in calculations

### AI Features
- Custom prompt generation for investment analysis
- Configurable AI settings in Settings page
- Integration with external AI services via prompts

### Data Persistence
- Google Drive integration for backup/restore
- Local storage for offline capability
- Export to CSV/JSON formats

### Testing Requirements
- All new components need corresponding tests in `__tests__/unit/components/`
- Integration tests for API interactions in `__tests__/integration/`
- Mock handlers in `__tests__/mocks/handlers.js`
- Use existing test patterns and utilities

## Development Tips

1. When modifying API calls, update both the service layer and corresponding MSW handlers
2. Run tests before committing - the project has strict coverage requirements
3. Use the visual coverage report to identify untested code paths
4. Follow the existing component structure and naming conventions
5. Ensure mobile responsiveness - the app is optimized for iOS devices
6. Consider Japanese users (primary target audience) in UI/UX decisions

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
NEVER commit actual API URLs or secrets to the repository. Follow these steps:

1. Copy `.env.example` to create your local environment files:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.development
   cp .env.example .env.production
   ```

2. Replace `YOUR_AWS_API_URL_HERE` with the actual backend URL in your local files

3. The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude all `.env*` files except `.env.example`

4. For production deployments, set environment variables directly in your hosting platform (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

### API Security
- The backend API URL should be kept confidential
- Use environment-specific API keys and credentials
- Enable CORS restrictions on the backend
- Implement rate limiting and authentication

### Test Environment Setup

1. **Local Testing**:
   ```bash
   # First time setup
   cp .env.test.example .env.test
   # Edit .env.test and replace YOUR_AWS_API_URL_HERE with actual URL
   
   # Run tests
   npm test
   ```

2. **CI/CD Environment** (GitHub Actions, etc.):
   - Add `REACT_APP_MARKET_DATA_API_URL` as a secret in your CI/CD platform
   - The test runner will automatically use environment variables if available
   
3. **Using Mock API**:
   - If `USE_API_MOCKS=true` is set in .env.test, tests will use MSW mocks instead of real API
   - This is useful for unit tests and when the backend is unavailable
