## Architecture Overview

This is a React-based portfolio management application with AI-powered investment analysis capabilities. Key architectural decisions:

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with functional components and hooks
- **Context API** for state management (AuthContext for auth, PortfolioContext for portfolio data)
- **TailwindCSS** for styling with custom theme colors
- **Recharts** for data visualization
- **Google OAuth** for authentication
- **Axios** for API calls with retry logic

### Testing Architecture
- **Jest + React Testing Library** for unit/integration tests
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** for API mocking
- Custom test runner script (`scripts/run-tests.sh`) with advanced options
- Coverage thresholds enforced (70-80% target)
- Visual coverage reporting with chart generation

### Key Patterns

1. **Service Layer Pattern**: All API calls go through `/src/services/` modules
   - `api.js`: Core API client with auth handling
   - `marketDataService.js`: Market data fetching with fallbacks
   - `adminService.js`: Admin functionality

2. **Context Bridge Pattern**: `ContextConnector` component bridges AuthContext and PortfolioContext

3. **Environment Configuration**: All API settings are dynamically fetched from AWS
   - No API URLs or keys stored in client
   - Configuration fetched from AWS at runtime
   - Enhanced security and easier maintenance

4. **Component Organization**:
   ```
   components/
   ├── auth/       # LoginButton, UserProfile
   ├── common/     # ErrorBoundary, ToastNotification, etc.
   ├── dashboard/  # Portfolio visualization components
   ├── data/       # Import/Export, Google Drive integration
   ├── layout/     # Header, TabNavigation, DataStatusBar
   ├── settings/   # Holdings/Allocation editors, AI prompt settings
   └── simulation/ # Investment simulation components
   ```

## Important Implementation Details

### API Integration
- All API endpoints dynamically configured from AWS
- Production API hosted on AWS (separate repository)
- **Batch API**: Use `fetchMultipleStocks` to fetch multiple tickers in one request
- Supports multiple market data sources with automatic fallback
- API keys and authentication handled server-side
- **Rate Limiting**: Circuit breakers, exponential backoff, request deduplication
- **Session-based auth**: Uses cookies with `withCredentials: true`

### Multi-Currency Support
- Handles JPY and USD
- Exchange rate fetching from multiple sources
- Automatic currency conversion in calculations

### AI Features
- Custom prompt generation for investment analysis
- Configurable AI settings in Settings page
- Integration with external AI services via prompts

### Data Persistence
- Google Drive integration for backup/restore
- Local storage for offline capability
- Export to CSV/JSON formats

### Testing Requirements
- All new components need corresponding tests in `__tests__/unit/components/`
- Integration tests for API interactions in `__tests__/integration/`
- Mock handlers in `__tests__/mocks/handlers.js`
- Use existing test patterns and utilities

## Development Tips

1. When modifying API calls, update both the service layer and corresponding MSW handlers
2. Run tests before committing - the project has strict coverage requirements
3. Use the visual coverage report to identify untested code paths
4. Follow the existing component structure and naming conventions
5. Ensure mobile responsiveness - the app is optimized for iOS devices
6. Consider Japanese users (primary target audience) in UI/UX decisions

## Build Issues and Notes

### React DOM Compatibility
- This project uses `react-dom` instead of `react-dom/client` for compatibility with react-scripts@3.4.4
- Use `ReactDOM.render()` instead of `ReactDOM.createRoot().render()`
- Node.js v22 requires `NODE_OPTIONS='--openssl-legacy-provider'` for building

### Dependency Management
- Use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to handle peer dependency conflicts
- MSW requires TypeScript 4.8+ but the project uses TypeScript 3.9.10
- Build process is handled by GitHub Actions with proper environment setup

### Deployment

#### Manual Deployment with Claude Code
For immediate deployment using Claude Code environment:

**Note**: Due to npm workspace conflicts in the monorepo structure, use the following method:

1. **Create an isolated copy for building**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   cp -r webapp webapp-build
   ```

2. **Install dependencies in the isolated copy**:
   ```bash
   cd webapp-build
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps --no-audit --no-fund
   ```

3. **Build with environment variables**:
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL='https://gglwlh6sc7.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod' \
   REACT_APP_DEFAULT_EXCHANGE_RATE='150.0' \
   NODE_OPTIONS='--openssl-legacy-provider' \
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Deploy to Cloudflare Pages**:
   ```bash
   wrangler pages deploy build --project-name=portfolio-manager
   ```

5. **Clean up**:
   ```bash
   cd ../..
   rm -rf frontend/webapp-build
   ```

**Important Notes**:
- This method avoids npm workspace conflicts by creating an isolated build directory
- Environment variables must be set at build time for React apps
- The deployment creates a preview URL first, then updates the main site

#### Automated Deployment
- Cloudflare Pages deployment is also automated via GitHub Actions
- Build artifacts are generated in `frontend/webapp/build/` directory
- Environment variables are configured in Cloudflare Pages dashboard

#### Deployment Notes
- Wrangler CLI must be installed and authenticated with Cloudflare
- The project name `portfolio-manager` corresponds to the Cloudflare Pages project
- Deployment URL: https://portfolio-manager-7bx.pages.dev

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
API configurations are fetched dynamically from AWS. The following environment variables are supported:

1. Required environment variables:
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://YOUR_AWS_API_URL_HERE.execute-api.YOUR_REGION.amazonaws.com
   REACT_APP_DEFAULT_EXCHANGE_RATE=150.0
   ```

2. Setup instructions:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.development
   cp .env.example .env.production
   # Edit files to replace YOUR_AWS_API_URL_HERE with actual URL
   ```

3. API endpoints, keys, and Google Client ID are fetched from AWS at runtime using the base URL

4. The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude all `.env*` files except `.env.example`

5. For production deployments, set `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` in your hosting platform's environment variables

### API Security
- All API configurations are managed server-side on AWS
- API keys and sensitive data never exposed to client
- CORS restrictions enforced on the backend
- Rate limiting based on authentication status
- **Authentication**: Session-based using cookies (no JWT tokens currently)
- **Important**: Backend needs to implement JWT token response for full functionality

### Test Environment Setup

1. **Local Testing**:
   ```bash
   # First time setup
   cp .env.test.example .env.test
   # Edit .env.test and replace YOUR_AWS_API_URL_HERE with actual URL
   
   # Run tests
   npm test
   ```

2. **CI/CD Environment** (GitHub Actions, etc.):
   - Add `REACT_APP_MARKET_DATA_API_URL` as a secret in your CI/CD platform
   - The test runner will automatically use environment variables if available
   
3. **Using Mock API**:
   - If `USE_API_MOCKS=true` is set in .env.test, tests will use MSW mocks instead of real API
   - This is useful for unit tests and when the backend is unavailable
